# Second Part of the TODO list, adding fetch

<!-- endhide -->

This exercise is meant to be completed after the [TODO list React application](https://4geeks.com/interactive-coding-tutorial/todo-list) because the first part is the perfect boilerplate to start using API's.

For this second part, we will sync our to-do list with a real database, using the following [RESTful](https://4geeks.com/lesson/understanding-rest-apis) and public API made for this exercise.

🔗 Click here to access to the [TODO-list API documentation](https://playground.4geeks.com/todo/docs).

This whole exercise is about asynchronous programming because the interactions *from* and *to* the server need to be done async. That way, the user does not have to wait for the information to arrive.

## 🌱 How to start this project

Do not clone this repository because we are going to be using a different template.

We recommend opening the `react boilerplate` using a provisioning tool like [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-github-codespaces) (recommended) or [Gitpod](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-use-gitpod). Alternatively, you can clone it on your local computer using the `git clone` command.

This is the repository you need to open or clone:

```text
https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello
```

**👉 Please follow these steps on** [how to start a coding project](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-start-a-project).

> 💡 Important: Remember to save and upload your code to GitHub by creating a new repository, updating the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and uploading the code to your new repository using the `add`, `commit` and `push` commands from the git terminal.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Make your TODO List sync with the backend API every time a task is added or deleted.
2. Add a "clear all tasks" button that will delete the entire list from the server and update the empty list on the front-end.

**👉 Key moments for integration:**

3. Load tasks on start (`useEffect`)
    - Use the `GET` method specified in the documentation **to fetch the list** and update the state that holds the task list.

4. Add a task.
    - Use the `POST` method specified in the documentation **to add a new task** and then use `GET` to update the task list.

5. Delete a task.
    - Use the `DELETE` method **to remove a task** and then `GET` to update the list.

6. Make sure to create a user before adding tasks.

## 💡 Hint:

Use the following fetch call to create a new task on the server. Remember to create a user first.

```js
fetch('https://playground.4geeks.com/todo/todos/alesanchezr', {
        method: "POST",
        body: JSON.stringify(task),
        headers: {
          "Content-Type": "application/json"
        }
     })
     .then(resp => {
          console.log(resp.ok); // Will be true if the response is successful
          console.log(resp.status); // Status code 201, 300, 400, etc.
          return resp.json(); // Will attempt to parse the result to JSON and return a promise where you can use .then to continue the logic
     })
     .then(data => {
          // This is where your code should start after the fetch is complete
          console.log(data); // This will print the exact object received from the server to the console
     })
     .catch(error => {
          // Error handling
          console.log(error);
     });
```

> ⚠️ For any other request, you must change the variables in the fetch: **The URL, the method, and the payload**.

# Hello World with React boilerplate

Start coding a react application

> If you are working locally instead of using codespaces or gitpod, please follow [local installation steps](#local-installation-skip-if-you-are-working-on-codespaces-or-gitpod) and come back to this part of the readme.

## How to start coding?

- Install the packages with `$ npm install`.
- Run the webpack server with `$ npm run start`

You can update the `styles/index.css` or `js/index.js` depending on your needs.
Add more files into your, `./src/js/components` or styles folder as you need them.

## Local Installation (skip if you are working on codespaces or gitpod)

Download the boilerplate using git

```
$ git clone https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello.git
$ cd react-hello
```

## Publish your website!

This boilerplate is 100% compatible with the free [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [vercel](https://vercel.com/) hosting.

It takes just 2 minutes to deploy, [click here to start the process](https://4geeks.com/docs/start/deploy-to-render-com).

## Other features

- Automatic Code Formatting: Use of [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for automatic code indentation and formatting.
- Error reporting: Use of [eslint](https://eslint.org/) for better error reporting.
